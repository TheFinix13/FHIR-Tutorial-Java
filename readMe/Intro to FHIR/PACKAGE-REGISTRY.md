[FHIR PACKAGE REGISTRY](https://registry.fhir.org/)
===============================================
- Note: All developers must note the difference between the base standards on the FHIR website and the actual implementation guides based on your project specifications
- To go about this, navigate to the package registry and search for the specific implementation guide you are working on.
  - (e.g. [US Core Implementation Guide](https://registry.fhir.org/package/hl7.fhir.us.core%7C6.1.0))
  - this is the Implementation Guide of **US** for FHIR R4 defining the **minimum conformance requirements** for accessing patient data.

- they come with standard libraries for different languages to help you get started with your project.
- However, this helps you identify what you can and should pull/push from the base standard to meet your project requirements.
