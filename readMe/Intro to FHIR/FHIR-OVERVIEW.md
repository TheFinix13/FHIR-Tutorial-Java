## Versions & Maturity Models
[Publication History](http://hl7.org/fhir/directory.html)

[Maturity Model](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Maturity+Model#:~:text=It's%20based%20on%20the%20CMM,criteria%20may%20evolve%20over%20time.&text=FMM0%20%3D%20the%20artifact%20has%20been%20published%20on%20the%20current%20build.)
- This page describes the 5 level FHIR maturity model for FHIR artifacts with the intention of giving implementers a sense of how mature an artifact is based on the level and types of review it has been subject to.
  =======================================
- FHIR standards evolve through different maturity levels, from draft to normative, for effective implementation.
    - Normative (No declared FMM): This is the most stable stage.
    - FMM5: implemented in at least five independent production systems.
    - FMM4: considered sufficiently stable for widespread use, but changes might still be made

[Resource Index](https://hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html)
- This page lists all the resources defined in the FHIR specification
  ======================================
- Beside each resource in the resource index, the maturity level is mentioned (N1 to 5). This helps in understanding the maturity of the resource.
    - For example, Patient resource is at maturity level N, which means it is normative and stable. [Patient Resource](https://hl7.org/fhir/patient.html)
    - whereas, the Account resource is at maturity level 2, which means it is draft and subject to change. [Account Resource](https://hl7.org/fhir/account.html)
